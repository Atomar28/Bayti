You are an expert front-end engineer and SaaS marketer. Refactor the existing Bayti Pricing page into a tabbed, conversion-optimized layout. Tech: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind (use shadcn/ui if available). Keep the current visual style (rounded-2xl cards, soft shadows, lots of whitespace, mobile-first). Route: /src/pages/Pricing.tsx (export default component).

GOALS
- Three tabs: “Enterprise SaaS”, “Managed Service”, “API & Integrations”.
- Show competitive per-call pricing on Managed + API.
- Add an Add-ons section (with COMING SOON badges for Lead Scraping).
- Include a comparison block (“priced to beat human callers”).
- Preserve your existing hero, trust banner, and CTAs, but update copy.

PAGE SECTIONS (in order)
1) Sticky Trust Banner (top)
   Copy: “Cheaper than hiring a human, as natural as one — runs 24/7 at scale.”
   Sub: “Founders’ Launch Pricing — limited time.”

2) Hero
   H1: “Simple, competitive pricing to scale your outbound”
   Sub: “Bayti is cheaper than hiring a human, but just as natural — and it works 24/7, never takes breaks, and dials at massive scale.”
   Primary CTA: “Start a campaign”
   Secondary CTA (ghost): “Talk to sales”
   Small note: “All plans include compliance tools and opt-out handling.”

3) Tabs (shadcn Tabs or custom):
   Tabs: [Enterprise SaaS] [Managed Service] [API & Integrations]
   Animated underline. Maintain internal state with useState.

UX / IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Reuse existing styles; ensure dark-mode friendly.
- Add small tooltips for thresholds, overages, and add-on pricing.
- Add tiny “COMING SOON” pill component (amber background, bold label).
- Keep mobile sticky CTA (“Talk to sales”).
- Componentize: PricingTabs, PlanCard, AddonCard, FAQItem, ValueProp.
- No external calls; static copy and prices hardcoded for now.
- Optional: a right-rail “Cost Estimator” widget that calculates Managed/API cost from user inputs (monthly calls, premium voices, priority routing). If calls exceed SaaS thresholds, show hint: “Enterprise might be cheaper.”

Deliver a complete, polished /src/pages/Pricing.tsx with all copy and interactions above wired and responsive.
