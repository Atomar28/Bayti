You are an expert front-end engineer and SaaS marketer. Build a production-ready, responsive **Pricing** page for “Bayti” inside a React + Vite + Tailwind project (use shadcn/ui where helpful). The page must be conversion-focused and accessible.

GOALS
- Sell Bayti with 3 pricing models: Enterprise SaaS (subscription), Managed Calling Service (per-call bundles), API SaaS/CPaaS (usage-based).
- Emphasize market-beating prices and humanlike AI.
- Include “COMING SOON” for lead scraping.
- Strong CTAs and trust elements.

TECH & STYLE
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind, clean modern aesthetic, rounded-2xl cards, soft shadows, good white space
- shadcn/ui for buttons/cards/switch/tabs if available
- Mobile-first, then desktop grid
- SEO-friendly: semantic tags, descriptive meta (title: “Bayti Pricing – AI Calling for Real Estate”)

PAGE SECTIONS (in order)
1) Sticky Trust Banner (top)
   - Copy: “Cheaper than hiring a human, as natural as one — runs 24/7 at scale.”
   - Small secondary: “Founders’ Launch Pricing—limited time.”

2) Hero
   - H1: “Simple, competitive pricing to scale your outbound”
   - Sub: “Bayti is cheaper than hiring a human, but just as natural — and it works 24/7, never takes breaks, and dials at massive scale.”
   - Primary CTA: “Start a campaign”
   - Secondary CTA (ghost): “Talk to sales”
   - Small line: “All plans include compliance tools and opt-out handling.”

3) Model Tabs (3 tabs with animated underline)
   - Tabs: “Enterprise SaaS”, “Managed Service”, “API”
   - Persist a short explainer per tab.

   - “What about international rates?” → “Pricing above assumes UAE; contact sales for other regions.”
   - “Can I switch plans later?” → “Yes, upgrade/downgrade anytime; prorated.”
   - “Do you offer pilots?” → “Yes—ask sales for a 7-day pilot on Enterprise or a 500-call trial on Managed Service.”
   - “Do you integrate with my CRM?” → “Enterprise SaaS includes CRM integrations; API also available.”

8) CTA Footer
   - Headline: “Ready to outcall the competition?”
   - Buttons: “Start a campaign” (primary), “Talk to sales” (secondary)

UI/UX REQUIREMENTS
- Pricing cards with toggleable monthly/annual view (annual shows 10% discount and “2 months free” style annotation)
- “COMING SOON” badges styled subtle amber pill
- Tooltips for thresholds, overage rates, add-ons
- Trust cues: small lock icon row: “GDPR-ready • Opt-out compliant • 99.9% uptime”
- Sticky “Talk to Sales” button on mobile
- Animations: subtle hover lift on cards; fade-in sections

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Create page at: /src/pages/Pricing.tsx
- Export default component; include all copy above (adjust styling—but keep exact prices and labels)
- Use Tailwind utility classes; ensure dark mode friendly
- No external calls; static content; componentize Card, Badge, CTAButton, FAQItem for re-use

BONUS (optional but try):
- A tiny “Cost Estimator” widget (right rail on desktop, bottom on mobile):
  Inputs: monthly calls, premium voices yes/no, priority routing yes/no
  Output: estimated monthly cost for Managed Service and API.
  Show an “Enterprise might be cheaper” hint if calls > threshold/seat scenario.
