Let’s fix the demo first—it’s almost always a tiny WebSocket/setup issue. If we jump straight to phone calls, we’ll still need sockets working (Twilio/Daily both stream over WS). Here’s a fast checklist + one tiny echo test to confirm the pipe.

Quick checks (90% of failures)
	1.	Open the app over HTTPS in a new tab
Click the “Open in new tab” button and make sure the URL is https://<your-repl>.repl.co (mic APIs + WSS need https).
	2.	Secrets set correctly
	•	MODE=interactive
	•	DRY_RUN=true (for now)
	•	PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://<your-repl>.repl.co
	3.	WS URL
In the client, you should build wss://<your-repl>.repl.co/ws/realtime (not ws://, not localhost).
	4.	Server uses the same HTTP server for WS upgrade
If you did app.listen(...) you must attach WS to the returned server (not just Express). Otherwise the upgrade never fires.
	5.	Path matches
Client connects to /ws/realtime and the server’s upgrade handler listens on exactly that path.
	6.	Browser devtools
Open DevTools → Network → WS. Try Connect. You should see 101 Switching Protocols. If it shows (pending) or error, copy the error here.
	7.	Server logs
Add a log on upgrade: console.log('WS upgrade', req.url) and on connect: console.log('WS open'). If you don’t see them, the upgrade isn’t wired.
	8.	Mic permission
The page should prompt for mic. If not, your getUserMedia isn’t running or the page isn’t served over https.

One-minute echo test (proves WS wiring)

Add this tiny echo alongside your realtime WS so we can isolate the problem:

// in your server entry where you create the HTTP server:
import { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';
import { parse } from 'url';

const wssEcho = new WebSocketServer({ noServer: true });

server.on('upgrade', (req, socket, head) => {
  const { pathname } = parse(req.url || '');
  if (pathname === '/ws/echo') {
    wssEcho.handleUpgrade(req, socket, head, (ws) => {
      ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'event', data: 'echo-connected' }));
      ws.on('message', (m) => ws.send(m)); // echo back
    });
  }
});

Then from the browser console run:

const ws = new WebSocket('wss://<your-repl>.repl.co/ws/echo');
ws.onmessage = (e)=>console.log('msg', e.data);
ws.onopen = ()=>ws.send(JSON.stringify({hello:'world'}));

You should see it echo. If echo works but /ws/realtime doesn’t, the issue is in the orchestrator route; if echo fails, it’s URL/https/upgrade wiring.

Likeliest fix (common in Replit/Vite setups)
	•	Ensure you’re not starting multiple servers. Typical pattern:

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
// attach your realtime init here, using `server.on('upgrade', ...)`
server.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);


	•	In the client, don’t use localhost or relative ws://. Build it from PUBLIC_BASE_URL and replace https → wss.

If you’d still prefer to go straight to on-call testing, we can. The simplest path is Twilio Media Streams (no SIP yet):
	•	Buy/verify a Twilio number → set voice webhook to your endpoint returning TwiML that starts a <Stream> to wss://<your-repl>.repl.co/ws/twilio.
	•	Handle the Twilio WS frames (base64 μ-law 8k) → decode → feed to STT; send TTS back via <Say> or stream RTP (for first cut, keep it simple).

But note: that’s also WebSockets under the hood—so we still need the WS bit working.

Want me to:
	•	read your current server entry file and show exactly where to attach the WS upgrade, or
	•	generate the Twilio Media Streams endpoint + TwiML so you can place a real call next?
