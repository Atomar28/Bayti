Yep—what you’re seeing does make sense.

The agent’s report basically says:
	•	✅ WebSocket connected
	•	✅ Session/orchestrator started
	•	✅ Audio frames are arriving
	•	❌ Deepgram is flagging them as silence, so no speech is getting transcribed

That almost always means the browser is sending either (a) near-zero audio (mic not actually capturing) or (b) audio in the wrong format/rate so it decodes to tiny values.

Here’s the quick fix list (in order):
	1.	Verify mic truly streams
	•	On the demo page, show mic RMS / level. While speaking you should see > 0.01. If it stays ~0.000x, the mic isn’t flowing.
	•	Ensure the page is opened over https and you allowed mic.
	2.	Send the right format
	•	Deepgram realtime expects PCM16, mono, 16kHz, ~20–40ms per chunk.
	•	In the browser: capture at device rate → resample to 16kHz, convert Float32 → Int16, then base64.
	•	Chunk size: 20ms → 320 samples; 40ms → 640 samples at 16k.

// Float32 [-1,1] → Int16 LE
function f32ToI16(float32) {
  const out = new Int16Array(float32.length);
  for (let i = 0; i < float32.length; i++) {
    let s = Math.max(-1, Math.min(1, float32[i]));
    out[i] = s < 0 ? s * 0x8000 : s * 0x7FFF;
  }
  return out;
}


	3.	Client capture sanity
	•	Use an AudioWorklet or ScriptProcessorNode to get frames.
	•	Resample to 16k if needed (many mics are 44.1k/48k). If you don’t have a resampler, the STT will hear mush/silence.
	4.	Deepgram socket config
	•	When opening the DG WS, send params like:

encoding=linear16&sample_rate=16000&punctuate=true&interim_results=true&utterance_end_ms=300


	•	Log the first 3 chunks sizes server-side and dump the first 8 bytes so we know we’re receiving real PCM.

	5.	Good debugging tells
	•	Browser: show RMS per chunk; log chunk length (should be ~320–640 samples for 20–40ms at 16k).
	•	Server: on first chunk, log avgAbs of samples (should be > 200 on Int16 when talking).
	6.	Use the “Test AI conversation” injector once
	•	It’s fine to have a button that injects a test phrase → LLM → TTS just to prove that path.
	•	But live STT still needs real mic audio or we’ll keep seeing silence_detected.

If you want, paste the client capture code section here (the bit that slices audio and sends audio:chunk). I’ll mark exactly what to change so Deepgram stops seeing silence.
